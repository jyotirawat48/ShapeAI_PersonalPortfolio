        <h1>SOMETHING ABOUT ME!</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone! Hope you all are safe and healthy. My name is Jyoti Rawat and I am currently pursuing BSc (Hons) Computer Science from SRCASW, DU. My hometown is Rishikesh, Uttarakhand and my hobbies are dancing, listening to music, travelling, reading books and sketching. It is a wonderful feeling as I have completed my HTML & CSS bootcamp for personal portfolio. I have also completed two more bootcamps offered by ShapeAI (Basic Web Development with JavaScript and ReactJS and Introduction to Cyber Security). ShapeAI is offering students knowledgable bootcamps free of cost and helping many students out there to enhance their learning. I am really grateful and also want to congratulate the whole team of ShapeAI for their hardwork. Apart from this, I have also completed internships as Brand Promoter at BLOOMBUZZ and as Brand Associate at The Ivory Events where I gained experience regarding social media marketing, team management, time management, leadership skills and other skills as well. Thank you.</p>
